Flag Description
r

Open for reading. An exception occurs if the file does not exist.

r+

Open for reading and writing. An exception occurs if the file does not exist.

rs

Open for reading in synchronous mode, which instructs the operating system to bypass the system cache. This is mostly used for opening files on NFS mounts; it does not make open() a synchronous method.

rs+

Open for reading and writing in synchronous mode.

w

Open for writing. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file already exists, it is truncated.

wx

Similar to the w flag, but the file is opened in exclusive mode. Exclusive mode ensures that the files are newly created.

w+

Open for reading and writing. If the file does not exist, it is created. If the file already exists, it is truncated.

wx+

Similar to the w+ flag, but the file is opened in exclusive mode.

a

Open for appending. If the file does not exist, it is created.

ax

a+

Open for reading and appending. If the file does not exist, it is created.
